Sept. 2017 - Aug. 2021 Ph.D Program at the Graduate School of Natural Science and Engineering
Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey.
| Summary: The focus of my Ph.D. thesis is exploring and developing array processing
techniques and systems to increase spectral efficiency in 5G and beyond technology,
where I applied beamforming, NOMA, and IRS. In particular, this thesis discuses DoA
estimation for massive MIMO systems, low complexity resources allocation for
partial-NOMA systems, and performance analysis of IRS-assisted NOMA.
| Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Kemal. M Özdemir
| Courses: Estimation Theory, Wireless Communications, Fuzzy Logic and Modeling,
Advanced Digital Communications, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.
CGPA: 3.87/4
Feb. 2015 - Aug. 2017 Master’s Program at the Graduate School of Natural Science and Engineering
Istanbul Sehir University, Istanbul, Turkey.
| Summary: The master thesis focuses on f-OFDM system with Peak to Average Power
Ratio reduction and power amplifier linearlization. Different filter designs suitable for
better time and frequency localization were analyzed and effect of nonlinear PA on
f-OFDM signals were discussed along with PA linearization technique.

Sept. 2009 - Feb. 2014 Bachelor Program at Faculty of Engineering,
International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
| Summary: This thesis analyzes the performance of dynamic source routing (DSR)
protocol in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network, where simulation of DSR with Manhattan City
Mobility Model was performed by using Network Simulator 2 (NS2) software, and
it was compared DSR with AODV protocol.
